Overview
========

These scripts are for checking the condition of hardware RAIDs on linux servers
and software RAIDs (MDs) on linux servers with nagios or icinga.

The package is split into two different lots of scripts, those that live on the
machine to be monitored (found in the client/ directory) and those nagios check
scripts that live on the monitoring server (found in the server/ directory).
