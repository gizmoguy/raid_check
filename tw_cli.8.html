<p><code>tw_cli(8)</code> - 3ware Storage Controller Management Command Line Interface 
(CLI) manpage / HTML Help Dcoument Version 3.0.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<pre>
 tw_cli                 Interactive Mode
 tw_cli -f file         Process from a file

<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p><em>tw_cli(8)</em> is a Command Line Interface Storage Management Software for 
3ware ATA RAID Controller(s). It provides controller, logical unit and drive
management. tw_cli can be used in both interactive and batch mode, providing
higher-level API (Application Programming Interface) functionalities.</p>
<p>The CLI prompt indicates the current object in focus, expressed in URI (Universal 
Resource Identifier) syntax consisting of a hostname (<em>//hostname</em>), and an object
path (<em>/path/path/object</em>) such as <em>//elvis/c0/u0</em>. User can set the focus to a
particular object by <em>focus URI</em>.</p>
<p>CLI also supports <em>comments</em>. Command lines beginning with <em>#</em> denotes start
of comment. This feature is mostly useful with batch processing via <em>-f script</em> 
flag.</p>
<p>CLI uses the following terminology:</p>
<p><strong>Logical Units.</strong>  Usually shortened to &quot;units&quot;, these are block devices presented
to the operating system.  A logical unit can be a one-tier, two-tier, or three-tier
arrangement.  Spare and Single logical units are examples of one-tier units. 
RAID-1 and RAID-5 are examples of two-tier units and 
as such will have sub-units. RAID-10 and RAID-50 are examples of three-tier units
and as such will have sub-sub-units.</p>
<p><strong>Port.</strong>  3ware controller models up to the 9650SE series have one or many ports
(typically 4, 8, 12, 16, or 24).  Each port can be attached to a single disk drive.
On a controller such as the 9650SE with a multilane serial port connector, one
connector supports four ports.  On the 9690SA and 9750 controllers, connections 
are made with phys and vports (virtual ports).</p>
<p><strong>Phy.</strong>  Phys are tranceivers that transmit and receive the serial data stream 
that flows between the controller and the drives.  The 9690SA controller 
have 8 phys.  These &quot;controller phys&quot; are associated with virtual ports (vports)
to establish up to 128 potential connections with the SAS or SATA drives.  Each 
controller phy can be connected to a single drive, or can be connected through
an expander to additional drives.</p>
<p><strong>VPort.</strong>  Connections from the 9690SA and 9750 controllers to drives are referred 
to as <em>virtual ports</em>, or vports.  A vport indicates the ID of a drive, whether
it is directly connected to the controller, or cascaded through one of more 
expanders.  The vport, in essense, is a handle in the software to uniquely 
identify a drive.  The port ID or vport ID allows a drive to be consistently
identified, used and managed in a RAID unit.  For dual-ported drives, although
there are two connections to a drive, the drive is still identified with one 
vport handle.  <strong>Note:</strong> With the controller summay via the command &quot;show&quot;, 
the number of (V)Ports shown may contain two times (2X) the number of drives
(suggesting the dual-ported drive type) even though the (V)Port column of 
the summary to the command &quot;/cx show&quot; contains only the number of vports 
corresponding to the number of drives.  This is because the drive is 
identified with only one vport handle.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For all practical purposes, hereafter port and vport are used 
interchangeably in reference to a drive (or disk).  Therefore, unless otherwise 
specified, the mention of port implies vport as well.  That is, while &quot;port&quot; 
is mentioned to denote a drive, it is implied that for the applicable controller 
series, the reference also applies to vport.</p>
<p>CLI supports a set of primary command syntax and a set of legacy command syntax 
that is the old or original command syntax.  <strong>Note:</strong> The primary command syntax
replaces that legacy command syntax and as such support for legacy commands will 
discontinue in the near future.</p>
<p>Please also note that some of the commands listed in this document are qualified 
with restrictions of controller type/model support.  For example, &quot;9000 series&quot; or
&quot;9550SX and higher&quot; may be next to a command.  The following is a summary of the 
controller qualified specifications.</p>
<p>Commands with:</p>
<pre>
  No specifications     Could be used across all controller platforms.  This includes 
                        the 7000 and 8000 series controllers.
  9000 series           Could be used in all controllers in the 9000 series.  This 
                        excludes the 7000 and 8000 series controllers, and includes
                        the 9550SX, 9590SE, 9650SE, 9690SA and 9750 controllers.
  9550SX and higher     For controller models 9550SX, 9650SE, 9690SA and 9750. 
  9650SE and higher     For controller models 9650SE, 9690SA and 9750.</pre>
<p>For the Mac system, while still true, the command qualifier is not meaningful
as all commmands are supported, provided the controller model is 9590SE or 9650SE 
(or above).</p>
<p>Here is a summary of the controllers and their associated support:</p>
<pre>

<p>Please note that the support items are accumulative down the list, excepted where 
noted.  Also, CCU (Chassis Control Unit) refers to the JMR enclosure/Sidecar.</p>
<p>This document organizes the CLI command set as different types of Object 
Messages, and descriptions and examples are presented for each object message 
or command.  While some of the system features could be invoked with one 
&quot;set&quot; command and correspondingly displayed with a &quot;show&quot; command and as such, 
information regarding the feature may be self-contained within the description 
of the set command, other features may require or involve a set of commands 
that work together and may not be so straight-forward.  For these, the command 
descriptions may present a fragmented view of the feature as a result.  For 
an encapsulated view of certain features and their relevant command set, please see 
the <strong>Features</strong> section of this document.</p>
<p>This document, therefore,  may be used as a reference for individual commands 
and also as a reference for supported features.  For the former please see 
the <strong>Primary Command Syntax</strong> sections, and for the latter please see the 
Features sections.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="primary_command_syntax">Primary Command Syntax</a></h1>
<p>The primary command syntax will replace the legacy command syntax in the future 
releases.  The new and improved command format follows a general grammar in 
the form:</p>
<pre>
 Object Message Attributes</pre>
<p>Objects can be shell commands or can specify a controller, logical unit,
port or vport (drive), or battery backup unit (bbu).  Messages are commands 
sent to the requested objects.  It may be a read operation such as for the
command &quot;show&quot;,  or a write operation for the set, delete, add, stop, start, 
or remove commands.  Attributes specify the values to read or write.  
Attributes are either <em>Boolean Attributes</em> or <em>Named Attributes</em>. Value of a Boolean
attribute is deduced by presence. Value of named attributes are
expressed in a &quot;key = value&quot; format.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="shell_object_messages">Shell Object Messages</a></h2>
<p>Shell Object Messages are commands (a.k.a. methods/messages) that are sent to
the Command Interpreter (a.k.a. Shell/CLI) itself.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="show" class="item"><em>show</em></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command shows a general summary of all detected controllers.  Note that the
appropriate kernel device drivers should be loaded for the list to show all 
controllers. The intention is to provide a global view of the environment.</p>
<p>Typical output looks like:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; show</pre>
<pre>
 Ctl     Model           Ports   Drives  Units   NotOpt   RRate   VRate   BBU
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 c0      7500-12         12      8       3       1        2       -       -
 c1      9506S-12        12      6       1       0        3       5       TESTING</pre>
<p>The output indicates that <em>Controller 0</em> is a 7500 model with 12 Ports, with 8 Drives
detected (attached), total of 3 Units, with one unit in a NotOpt (Not Optimal) state,
a RRate(Rebuild Rate) of 2, VRate(Verify Rate) of '-' (Not Applicable), BBU of '-'
(Not Applicable).  Not Optimal refers to any state except OK and VERIFYING.  Other
states include INITIALIZING, INIT-PAUSED, REBUILDING, REBUILD-PAUSED, DEGRADED, 
MIGRATING, MIGRATE-PAUSED, RECOVERY, INOPERABLE, and UNKNOWN.</p>
<p>For a system with an enclosure unit as an attached expander, and the appropriate 
controller (9690SA), a global view of the environment includes summary 
information about detected enclosures.  As example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; show</pre>
<pre>
 Ctl    Model          (V)Ports  Drives  Units   NotOpt  RRate   VRate  BBU
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 c0     G133e/Astor    12        4       1       0       1       1      -</pre>
<pre>
 Encl    Slots   Drives  Fans   TSUnits  PSUnits
 --------------------------------------------------
 /c0/e0  4       2       1      1        1</pre>
<p>The enclosure summary information shows the name of the enclosure, and the
number of elements within each element type that is part of the system as 
identified during discovery.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="show_ver" class="item"><strong>show</strong> <em>ver</em></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command will show the CLI and API version.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; show ver      
 
 CLI Version = 2.00.03.018
 API Version = 2.01.00.004</pre>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="show_events_reverse" class="item"><strong>show</strong> <em>events</em> [<em>reverse</em>]</a></strong></dt>

<dt><strong><a name="show_aens_reverse" class="item"><strong>show</strong> <em>AENs</em> [<em>reverse</em>]</a></strong></dt>

<dt><strong><a name="show_alarms_reverse" class="item"><strong>show</strong> <em>alarms</em> [<em>reverse</em>]</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command shows the controller alarms or events, also known as AEN 
(Asynchronous Event Notification) messages, of all controllers in the
system.  The default display shows the most recent alarm at the end or
bottom of the table.  The <em>reverse</em> attribute reverses this order and 
shows the most recent alarm at the top of the table.  For more information 
please see '<em>/cx show AENs</em>'.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="show_diag" class="item"><strong>show</strong> <em>diag</em></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command shows the diagnostic information of all controllers in the
system.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="show_rebuild" class="item"><strong>show</strong> <em>rebuild</em></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command displays all rebuild schedules of all the 9000 controllers 
in the system.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="show_selftest" class="item"><strong>show</strong> <em>selftest</em></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command displays all self test schedules of all the 9000 controllers
in the system.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="show_verify" class="item"><strong>show</strong> <em>verify</em></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command displays all verify schedules of all the 9000 controllers
in the system.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="update_fw_filename_with_path_force" class="item"><strong>update</strong> <em>fw=filename_with_path</em> [<em>force</em>]</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command iterates through all the controllers in the system and downloads
the specified firmware image to the architecturally compatible controllers.
Please refer to command <em>/cx update fw=filename_with_path [force]</em> for detail.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="focus_object" class="item"><strong>focus</strong> <em>Object</em></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command will set the specified object in focus. This command is active in
interactive mode only and is provided to reduce typing.  Recall that messages (or
commands) are sent to objects such as</p>
<pre>
 //hostname/c0/u0 show</pre>
<p>Instead, if the focus is set to <em>//hostname/c0/u0</em>, the prompt is changed 
automatically to reflect this and the user would only have to type <em>show</em>.
The concept is similar to being in a particular location in a file system and
requesting a listing of the current directory.</p>
<p><em>object</em> can have the following forms:</p>
<p><em>//hostname/cx/ux</em> specifies the fully qualified URI of an object on host 
<strong>hostname</strong>, controller <strong>cx</strong>, unit <strong>ux</strong>.</p>
<p><em>//hostname</em> specifies root of host <strong>hostname</strong>.  The hostname is the name of 
the system where your 3ware RAID controllers are.  With current releases, the 
hostname here should be always your system's name.</p>
<p><em>..</em> specifies one level up (the parent object).</p>
<p><em>/</em> specifies the root at the current focused host.</p>
<p><em>./obj</em> specifies the next level of the object.</p>
<p><em>/c0/bbu</em> specifies a relative path with respect to the current focused hostname.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; focus //elvis.3ware.com
 //elvis.3ware.com&gt;</pre>
<pre>
 //elvis.3ware.com&gt; focus /c0/u0
 //elvis.3ware.com/c0/u0&gt;</pre>
<pre>
 //elvis.3ware.com/c0/u0&gt; focus ..
 //elvis.3ware.com/c0&gt;</pre>
<pre>
 //elvis.3ware.com/c0&gt; focus ./u0
 //elvis.3ware.com/c0/u0&gt;</pre>
<pre>
 //elvis.3ware.com/c0&gt; focus /
 //elvis.3ware.com&gt;</pre>
<p>Note that <em>focus</em> is available as default.  You can also set <em>TW_CLI_INPUT_STYLE=OLD</em>
in the following to disable the feature.</p>
<pre>
 If Bash,    then &quot;export TW_CLI_INPUT_STYLE=OLD&quot;
 If csh,     then &quot;setenv TW_CLI_INPUT_STYLE OLD&quot;
 If Windows, then &quot;set    TW_CLI_INPUT_STYLE=OLD&quot;</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="controller_object_messages">Controller Object Messages</a></h2>
<p>Controller Object Messages are commands (a.k.a. methods/messages) that are sent to
an instance of a controller such as <em>/c0</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="cx_show" class="item"><em>/cx</em> <strong>show</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command shows summary information on the specified controller <em>/cx</em>. This 
report consists of two to three parts: the <strong>Unit Summary</strong> that lists all units
present, the <strong>Port Summary</strong> that lists the ports and disks attached to them, 
and if a BBU unit is installed, the <strong>BBU Summary</strong> that shows information on 
the BBU.</p>
<p>The <strong>Unit Summary</strong> section lists the units present with the unit number,
unit type (such RAID 5), and unit status (such as OK, VERIFYING, INITIALIZING, 
etc.).  The <strong>%RCompl</strong> reports the percent completion of the unit's Rebuild, if
this task is in progress.  The <strong>%V/I/M</strong> reports the percent completion of the 
unit's Verify, Initialize, or Migrate, if one of these are in progress.  The 
stripe size, the usable capacity in gigabytes, the cache setting, and the 
autoverify setting are also listed.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:  If a &quot;*&quot; appears at the end of the status, there is an error on one of 
the drives in the unit.  Rescanning the controller will clear the error status 
if the condition no longer exists.</p>
<p>For controller models up to the 9550SX and 9650SE with Release 9.5.1 or 
earlier, the <strong>Port Summary</strong> section lists all present ports and for each port,
the port number, drive status, unit affiliation, drive size (in blocks of 512 
bytes), and the disk vendor assigned serial number are reported.</p>
<p>For the 9750, 9690SA and 9650SE controller with Release 9.5.2 or later, 
this section lists the ports or virtual ports present and for each port, the port
or virtual port (VPort) number, drive status, unit affiliation, drive type, 
phy number (if direct attached), the enclosure and slot (if expander attached), 
and model number of the drive are reported.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Unlike the 9550SX or older display, if a drive is not present, instead
of showing the port with the status NOT-PRESENT with dashes ('-') across the 
columns in the summary table, for the 9750, 9690SA and 9650SE with Release 9.5.2 
or later, that port entry is not listed.  Thus, unlike the older display, the 
port numbers in this list may not be sequential.  Moreover, if there are no 
drives present at all for the specified controller, the output of its Port 
Summary would show an empty summary consisting of only the header.</p>
<p>The <strong>BBU Summary</strong> section lists the online state, readiness, and status of
the BBU unit, along with the voltage, temperature, charge capacity expressed
as time remaining in hours, and the BBU's last test date.</p>
<p>Additional attributes about controllers, units, ports and disks can be obtained
by querying for them directly. See other show sub-commands below.</p>
<p>Here is the typical output for controller models up to 9550SX and 9650SE with 
Release 9.5.1 or earlier:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The 'Cache' column in the unit summary differ between the older (up to
9550SX and 9650SE with Release 9.5.1 or earlier) and newer (9750, 9690SA and 
9650SE with Release 9.5.2 or later) controllers.  In the unit summary of the 
&quot;older&quot; controllers, this column shows the state (ON or OFF) of the write cache 
only.  For the &quot;newer&quot; controllers, the 'Cache' column displays the settings of 
both the read cache and the write cache.  For example:</p>
<pre>
 Unit  UnitType  Status         %RCmpl  %V/I/M  Stripe  Size(GB)  Cache  AVrfy
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 u0    RAID-5    OK             -       -       64K     596.004   W      OFF

<p>In the above example, W denotes that the write cache is enabled, and RiW denotes 
that Read Cache Intelligent and the Write Cache are both enabled. If OFF is 
shown then all caches are disabled.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of the possible settings in that column:</p>
<pre>
 W   - only the write cache is enabled
 Rb   - only read cache Basic is enabled
 Ri  - only read cache Intelligent is enabled
 RbW  - read cache Basic and write cache are both enabled
 RiW - read cache Intelligent and write cache are both enabled
 OFF - all read and write caches are disabled</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If read cache Intelligent is enabled, the features in the Basic mode 
are also enabled.</p>

<p>This command shows the Auto-Carving policy.  If the policy is on, all
newly created or migrated units larger than carvesize will be automatically 
carved into multiples of carvesize volumes and 1 remainder volume.  
Each volume can be treated as an individual disk with its own file system.  
The default carvesize is 2 TB.</p>
<p>This feature is useful for operating systems limited to 2 TB filesystems.  
For 64-bit OS users, there is no need to set the policy to be &quot;on&quot; 
unless users want to have multiple smaller volumes to the OS.  
For 32-bit OS users, it is recommended to keep the policy on unless users 
know their OS supports more than 2 TB disk devices.</p>
<p>When autocarve policy is off, all the new unit creation consists of one 
single volume.</p>

<p>This command allows you to add a new unit or create a unit on the specified 
controller <em>/cx</em>, of type <em>RaidType</em>, optional stripe size of <em>Stripe</em>, 
using one or many disks specified by <em>disk=p:-p</em>. By default the host 
operating system will be informed of the new block device and write cache 
is enabled. In case of RAID-50, you can also specify the layout of the unit 
by specifying the number of disks per disk group with <em>group=3|4|5|6|7|8</em> 
attribute.</p>
<p>Upon the success of the new unit creation, a unique serial number is also 
assigned to the new unit.  Please refer to commands <em>/cx/ux show serial</em> 
for checking.</p>
<p>Please Note:  
1) The default of the unit creation sets write cache to &quot;on&quot; for performance 
reasons.  However, if there is no BBU available for the controller, a warning 
is sent to standard error.
2) The default drive queuing policy is enabled, unless it is specifically set
to disable queuing by specifing <em>noqpolicy</em>.
3) The <em>noqpolicy</em> attribute is not applicable to the &quot;spare&quot; unit.  Specifying 
the noqpolicy attribute returns an error.</p>
<p>Since this command is by far the richest command, it deserves more details.</p>

<p><strong>disk=p:-p</strong> consists of a list of ports (disks) to be used in the construction
of the specified unit type. One or more ports can be specified. Multiple
ports can be specified using <strong>&quot;:&quot;</strong> or <strong>&quot;-&quot;</strong> as port index separators.
A dash indicates a range and can be mixed with &quot;:&quot;. For example
<strong>disk=0:1:2-5:9:12</strong> indicates port 0, 1, 2 thru 5 (inclusive), 9 and 12.</p>
<p><strong>stripe=size</strong> consists of the stripe size to be used.  The following
table illustrates the supported and applicable stripes on unit types and
controller models. Stripe size of units are in KB (kilobytes).</p>

<p><strong>group=3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16</strong> consists of the number of disks per group 
for a Raid 50 type.  <strong>Note:</strong> This attribute can only be used when type=raid50. Also,
group=13-16 is applicable to the 9690SA and 9750 controllers only.</p>
<p>Recall that a RAID-50 is a multi-tier array. At the most bottom layer,
N number of disks per group are used to form the RAID-5 layer. These
RAID-5 arrays are then integrated into a RAID-0. This attribute allows
you to specify the number of disks in the RAID-5 level. Valid values
are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.</p>
<p>Note that a sufficient number of disks are required for a given pattern or
disk group. For example, given 6 disks, specifying 3 will create two RAID-5.
However given 12 disks, specifying 3 will create four RAID-5 under the RAID-0 
level.  Given 6 disks and grouping of 6 is not allowed, as you'll basically 
be creating a RAID-5.</p>
<p>The default group varies based on number of disks. For 6 &amp; 9 disks, default 
is group=3.  For 8 disks, default is group=4. For 10 or 15 disks, default is 
group=5.  For 12 or 16 disks, default is group=4.  For 14 disks, default is 
group=7.  Case of 12 disks could be grouped with group=3, group=4, or group=6. 
Group=4 was set by default as it provides best net capacity and performance.  
Case of 15 disks could be grouped with group=3 or group=5.  And case 
of 16 disks could be grouped with group=4 and group=8.</p>
<p>Note that the supported group number indicated depends on the number of ports
on the controller.  group=16 is the maximum and it is available on the 9690SA 
and 9750 controllers only.</p>
<p><strong>noscan</strong> attribute instructs CLI not to notify OS of creation of the new unit.
By default CLI will inform the OS. One application of this feature is to avoid 
the OS from creating block special devices such as /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc as some 
implementations might create naming fragmentation and creating a moving target.</p>
<p><strong>nocache</strong> or <strong>nowrcache</strong> attribute instructs CLI to disable the write cache 
on the newly created unit.  Enabling the write cache increases performance at 
the cost of high-availability.  No caching is recommended when no BBU or UPS 
is installed.  The system default for the write cache is enable.  If a BBU or
UPS is not installed, to avoid possibility of data loss in the event of sudden
power loss, it is recommended that nocache or nowrcache be specified.</p>
<p><strong>nordcache</strong> attribute instructs CLI to disable the read cache on the newly 
created unit. Enabling the read cache increases performance. The <strong>rdcachebasic</strong> 
attribute instructs CLI to set the read cache mode on the newly created unit 
to <em>Basic</em>.  Please note that it is not necessary to include any read cache 
attribute if you wish to select the <em>Intelligent</em> mode of Read Cache, since 
the system default is Read Cache Intelligent.  See &quot;/cx/ux set rdcache&quot; for 
more information.</p>
<p><strong>autoverify|noautoverify</strong> attribute enables or disables, respectively, the 
autoverify attribute on the unit that is to be created. For more details on this 
feature, refer to the <em>/cx/ux set autoverify</em> command section of this document.  
This feature is not supported on controller models 7000/8000. For the 9650SE, 
9690SA, and 9750 controllers that support Basic Verify, autoverify will be set 
to ON by default for the new unit to be created.  For other 9000 series controllers 
that do not support Basic Verify, autoverify is set to OFF by default for the new 
unit. The following table should help clarify regarding the defaults:</p>
<pre>
  ---------------------+--------------------+----------------------
    &quot;ADD&quot; COMMAND      |  9550SX AND HIGHER |  9650SE AND HIGHER 
     ATTRIBUTE         |   (No BV support)  |   (has BV support)
  ---------------------+--------------------+---------------------- 
   None specified      |                    |
   (i.e., use default) |  autoverify = OFF  |  autoverify = ON 
  ---------------------+--------------------+----------------------
    autoverify         | Enables AutoVerify | 
                       |  autoverify = ON   |   No effect*
  ---------------------+--------------------+----------------------
    noautoverify       |                    | Enables AutoVerify
                       |    No effect*      |  autoverify = ON
  ---------------------+--------------------+----------------------
 
 *No effect means that, issuing the add command attribute of that row would
  be the same as not issuing any attribute and using the default.</pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: while there is no reason to issue both <em>autoverify</em> and <em>noautoverify</em>
together at unit creation, CLI allows you to do so.  Keep in mind however, that 
in this case,  only the last value specified would be used.  That is, for 
example, if you specified the command '/c0 add type=raid5 disk=0-2 autoverify 
noautoverify', then you are essentially specifying that 'autoverify=OFF' for /c0.</p>
<p><strong>noqpolicy</strong> attribute instructs CLI to disable the qpolicy (drive queuing) on the 
newly created unit.  The default qpolicy is <em>on</em> (i.e., noqpolicy is not specified).
For the spare unit, drive queueing is not meaningful and the qpolicy cannot 
be set.  During unit creation, specifying <em>noqpolicy</em> for spare returns an error.</p>
<p><strong>ignoreECC</strong> attribute enables the ignoreECC/OverwriteECC attribute on the unit 
that is to be created. For more details on this feature, refer to <em>/cx/ux set</em> 
commands section of this document. The following table illustrates the supported 
Model / Unit Type.  This table only applies to setting this feature at unit creation 
time. Generally, ignoreECC applies to redundant units.</p>

<p><strong>name=string</strong> attribute allows user to name the new unit.  The maximum characters 
allowed for the string are 21.  No space is allowed within the string.  If user likes
to use some special characters which the OS command shell reserves such as '&lt;', '&gt;',
'!', and '&amp;', etc in the name string, the user has to use quote &quot;&quot; around the name
string in order to bypass the command shell.  User can change the name of the unit 
any time after the unit creation.  This is a feature for 9000 or above series of
controllers.  Please refer to commands <em>/cx/ux set name=sting</em> for changing the 
name and <em>/cx/ux show name</em> for checking.</p>
<p><strong>storsave=protect|balance|perform</strong> attribute allows user to set the storsave policy
of the new unit. This feature is for controller models 9550SX and higher only.  Please 
refer to the command <em>/cx/ux set storsave=protect|balance|perform</em> for detail.</p>
<p>Either the <strong>v0=n</strong> or <strong>vol=a:b:c:d</strong> attribute may be used to set the size of the 
first volume or (up to) the first 4 volumes of the new unit, respectively.  The 
first volume may, but not necessarily, be the boot LUN.  The value(s) should be
positive integer(s) in units of gigabytes (GB).  Zero (0) is an invalid LUN 
size input value.  The upper user input limit is 32TB.  Note that there
are two ways to set the first volume, as either v0=n or vol=n would have the 
same effect.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  If the total size of the specified volumes (up to 4) exceeds the 
size of the array, the volume(s) of size(s) that exceeded the array boundary
will not be carved.</p>
<p>Example (RAID-5 being created with the first volume size set to 10 GB):</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c0 add type=raid5 disk=2-5 v0=10</pre>

<p>The attribute <strong>rapidrecovery</strong> specifies the Rapid RAID Recovery setting for
the unit to be created.  Rapid RAID Recovery can speed up the rebuild 
process, and it can speed up the initialize and verify tasks for redundant 
arrays in the RAID system upon the event of an unclean system shutdown.  
This feature allows for expedited boot-up time in the event of an unclean 
shutdown.  Setting this option to <em>all</em> applies the policy to the rebuild,
initialize and verify tasks at reboot.  Setting it to <em>rebuild</em> applies the 
policy to the rebuild tasks only.  If the policy is set to <em>disable</em>, then 
none of the tasks would be sped up.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this attribute is set, the policy setting is persistent in the 
system until it is disabled.  Also, once disabled, that setting could not be 
changed for that unit at a later time.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This attribute is for controller models 9750, 9690SA and 9650SE (with 
supporting firmware), and is for redundant arrays only.  In addition, 
Rapid RAID Recovery is not supported over migration.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The default setting of Rapid RAID Recovery is 'all' for redundant
arrays.  For non-redundant arrays the default is disabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="cx_rescan_noscan" class="item"><em>/cx</em> <strong>rescan</strong> [<em>noscan</em>]</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command instructs the controller to rescan all ports and reconstitute
all units. The controller will update its list of ports (attached disks), and visits
every DCB (Disk Configuration Block) in order to re-assemble its view and
awareness of logical units.  Any newly found unit(s) or drive(s) will be listed.
<em>noscan</em> is used to not inform the OS of the unit discovery. Default is to inform 
the OS.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c1 rescan</pre>
<pre>
 Rescanning controller /c1 for units and drives ...Done.
 Found following unit(s): [/c1/u3].
 Found following drive(s): [/c1/p7, /c1/p8].</pre>
<p>Note: Does not import non-JBOD on 7000/8000 models.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="cx_commit" class="item"><em>/cx</em> <strong>commit</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command instructs the controller to commit its dirty DCBs to
persistent storage (ie disks). While controller is processing I/O requests
against underlying disks, an in-transaction bit is set. If a failure (such
as power failure) is experienced, subsequent read from the disks, will inform
the controller that an un-clean shutdown took place. This command allows the
end user to complete all pending I/Os on disks and clear the in-transaction
bit.</p>
<p>Typical application of this feature is when an application is using a given
unit in raw mode (such as databases) and user would like to shutdown the
host (Including UPS post failure automations). This command can then expedite
the process by instructing the controller to finish pending requests, clear
DCB's in-transaction flag as we are going down.</p>
<p>Note that block devices (cooked devices) do not require this and clients of
block devices (such as file systems) will send its own shutdown request to the 
devices.</p>
<p>This command only applies to Windows operating system.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="cx_flush" class="item"><em>/cx</em> <strong>flush</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command allows you to flush the write cache on all units associated with

</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="cx_update_fw_filename_with_path_force" class="item"><em>/cx</em> <strong>update</strong> <em>fw=filename_with_path</em> [<em>force</em>]</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command allows the download of the specified firmware image to the corresponding
controller.  This command is for 9000 series controllers only.</p>
<p><strong>fw=filename_with_path</strong> attribute allows the user to specify the firmware image file
name along with its path.  Please note that <em>filename_with_path</em> could not have
spaces in the directory names of its path (as Windows would allow).</p>
<p>The new image specified by <em>filename_with_path</em> will be checked for compatibility 
with the current controller, current driver and current application versions.  
Subsequently a recommendation is given to the user followed by a prompt to continue.  
Once the user decides to proceed, the image will be downloaded to the controller.  
However, a reboot is required for the new image to take effect.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c2 update fw=/tmp/prom0006.img</pre>

<dd>
<p>Asynchronous events or AENs (Asynchronous Event Notifications) of the controller, 
also known as 'controller alarms', are originated by firmware and captured by 
their respective device drivers. These events are kept in a finite queue inside 
the kernel, awaiting extraction by user space programs such as CLI and/or 3DM2. 
These events reflect messages of varying severity levels.  The levels range 
in order of severity: INFO, WARNING, and ERROR, respectively.</p>
<p>Controller Events or Alarms generated on the 7000/8000 series controllers do not 
have dates, as such a dash ('-') indicating 'read not-applicable' is displayed 
in the &quot;Date&quot; column. Also, with the 7000/8000 series controllers, the event
message contains the severity as well, hence the &quot;Severity&quot; column shows a '-' 
also.</p>
<p>This command displays all available events on a given controller.  The default 
listing order is 'ascending'; that is, the later the alarm or event message the 
further down in the list or table it appears in.  Likewise, the older the event 
message the earlier it is in the table.  The order of the messages could be 
reversed with the attribute <em>reverse</em>.  With this the most recent AEN message 
would appear at the top of the table.</p>
<p>Typical output looks like:</p>

<p>This command is for the 9650SE with Release 9.5.2 or later, and the 9690SA 
or newer controllers only.  It reports a list of phys with related information 
for the specified controller.  The 'Device Type' column indicates whether 
the connected device is an enclosure, or a drive of type SATA or SAS.  The 
'Device' column is the device ID or handle.  There are three 'Link Speed' 
columns: 'Supported' denotes the link speed capability of the phy/device, 
'Enable' denotes the current link speed setting, and 'Control' denotes the 
link control setting.</p>
<p>Example of 9690SA-8E connected to drives in an enclosure:</p>

<p>In the above example, for phy1, the link speeds supported are 1.5 and 3.0 Gpbs.
The current link speed for phy1 is 3.0 Gpbs, and the link control setting is
'Auto'.  The link control setting could be either 1.5, 3.0, or Auto.  'Auto' 
denotes Automatic Negotiation, where the best negotiated speed possible for 
that link will be used.</p>

<p>Model 9000 series controllers support background tasks such as rebuild, verify, 
or self test activities. For each activity, up to 7 tasks can be registered, 
known as slots 1 through 7. Each task activity can be managed by a set of 
commands including <em>add</em>, <em>del</em>, <em>show</em> and <em>set</em>. Background tasks have 
a slot id, start day, hour, duration, and status attributes.</p>
<p>Rebuild activity attempts to (re)synchronize all members of redundant units 
such as RAID-1, RAID-10, RAID-5 and RAID-50. Rebuilds can be started manually 
or automatically if a spare has been defined. Scheduled rebuilds will take 
place during the scheduled window, if enabled.</p>

<dd>
<p>This command shows the current rebuild mode setting of the specified controller.
The rebuild mode has two settings: &quot;Adaptive&quot; and &quot;Low latency&quot;.</p>
<p>The Adaptive setting tells the controller to keep its current background activity 
task policy and it is the default.  The Low Latency setting &quot;throttles&quot; the 
background task and allow host Reads to complete, thus improves performance in 
the situation when a rebuild background task is active with the task rate has 
been set to high (that is, low I/O rate).</p>
<p>This command is associated with the rebuild task rate, please also see /cx show 
rebuildrate.</p>
<p>This command is supported on the 9650SE controller with Release 9.5.2 or later
and for the 9690SA and higher model controllers.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c1 show rebuildmode
 /c1 Rebuild background task mode = Low Latency</pre>

<p>The execution priority relative to I/O operations for the rebuild background task 
is the rebuild task rate.  This command shows the current rebuild task rate of the 
specified controller.</p>
<p>This task rate is of the range [1..5], where 5 denotes the setting of fastest 
background task and slowest I/O, as follows:</p>
<pre>
 5 = fastest rebuild; slowest I/O
 4 = faster rebuild; slower I/O
 3 = balanced between rebuild and I/O
 2 = faster I/O; slower rebuild
 1 = fastest I/O; slowest rebuild</pre>
<p>This command applies to the 7000, 8000, and 9000 models controllers.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c1 show rebuildrate
 /c1 Rebuild background task rate = 4 (faster rebuild; slower I/O)</pre>

<dd>
<p>Verify is one of the supported background tasks, and this command displays the 
current verify schedule.</p>
<p>For the 9650SE and newer RAID controllers, the Verify Task Schedule can be either 
<strong>basic</strong> or <strong>advanced</strong> (For details about the two types and the associated
commands, please see the 'Features' section.)  The basic Verify Task Schedule 
sets a weekly day and time for verification to occur, and is designed to be 
used with unit auto-verify. The advanced Verify Task Schedule provides 
more control, and is equivalent to the Verify Task Schedule available for 
9550SX and earlier RAID controllers.</p>
<p>For the advanced Verify Task Schedule, up to 7 time periods can be registered, 
known as timeslots (or simply slots) 1 through 7. This task schedule can be 
managed by a set of commands including <em>add</em>, <em>del</em>, <em>show</em> and <em>set</em>. The task 
schedule has a slot id, start-day-time, duration, and status attributes. Rebuild
follow similar background task schedules.</p>
<p>For details about setting up a schedule for verify tasks, see <em>/cx set verify</em>.</p>
<p>Verify activity attempts to verify all units based on their unit type.  Verifying
RAID-1 involves checking that both drives contain the exact data.  On RAID-5 and 
RAID-6, the parity information is used to verify data integrity. RAID-10 and 50 
are composite types and follow their respective array types. On the 9000 series, 
non-redundant units such as RAID-0, JBOD, single, and spare, are also verified 
(by reading and reporting un-readable sectors).</p>
<p>Example 1:
For the 9550SX and older controllers, and when verify=advanced for the 9650SE and 
newer controllers, the show verify command displays the current verify background 
task schedule as illustrated below.</p>

<p>When a rebuild background task is active, if the task rate is set to high 
(i.e., low I/O rate), the system latency increases and performance is negatively 
affected.  This command allows you to offset this condition by setting the rebuild 
mode to low latency.  This setting will &quot;throttle&quot; the background task and allow 
host Reads to complete, thus improving performance.</p>
<p>The rebuild mode has two settings: &quot;Adaptive&quot; and &quot;Low latency&quot;.  The Adaptive 
setting tells the controller to keep its current background activity task policy 
and it is the default.  The Low Latency setting has been described above.</p>
<p>This command is associated with the rebuild task rate, please also see /cx set 
rebuildrate.</p>
<p>This command is supported on the 9650SE controller with Release 9.5.2 or later,
and for the 9690SA and higher model controllers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Setting rebuildmode to 'low latency' and rebuildrate to '1' is not recommended 
when I/O is active, because in that case, the rebuild as a background task may never 
complete.  Thus, this setting should be used with care.</p>

<p>The execution priority relative to I/O operations for the rebuild background task 
is the rebuild task rate.  The rebuild task rate set to &quot;fastest&quot; will consume all 
of the controller's resources and will correspondingly deter I/O operations.  
Accordingly, the converse is also true.</p>
<p>This task rate is of the range [1..5], where 5 denotes the setting of fastest

<p>This command will <em>enable</em> or <em>disable</em> all of the scheduled verify background 
tasks on controller <em>/cx</em>.  When enabled, only registered or scheduled 
tasks will execute. Any previous on-demand (manually started) background tasks 
will be ignored.</p>
<p>This command allows you to set the verify task rate.  Setting this value to 5 
implies that the verify will consume 100% of the controller's resource (cpu time, 
I/O bandwidth) to complete its task. Conversely setting this value to 1 implies 
that I/O operations has higher priority and the verify will consume minimal 
resource.  In other words:</p>
<pre>
 5 = fastest verify; slowest I/O
 4 = faster verify; slower I/O
 3 = balanced between verify and I/O
 2 = faster I/O; slower verify
 1 = fastest I/O; slowest verify</pre>
<p>Note that this feature only applies to 9000 and higher controller models.</p>
<p>For &quot;verify&quot; background task description, see command <strong>/cx show verify</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Enabling verify with this command is equivalent to using the 
'/cx set verify=advanced' command for 9650SE and 9690SA controllers. For 
9650SE and higher model controllers, disabling verify with this command is 
equivalent to using the '/cx set verify=basic' command without specifying 
a preferred start day and time (the default of Friday midnight/Saturday 
morning is used.)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you want verify to occur automatically, when enabling the
verify schedule you must also remember to enable the autoverify setting for
the units to be verified.  For more information, see the command

Release 9.5.2 or later.</p>
<p>This command is effectively the same as the 'set verify' command.  
Setting verify to <em>advanced</em> enables the Verify Tasks Schedule, which

<p>Using the verify=basic option allows you to set a basic verify schedule 
that starts each week at the same date and time. With verify=basic, you 
can specify your preferred day and time, or use the default weekly schedule
of Friday midnight/Saturday morning.</p>
<pre>

When you set verify=basic, the table of scheduled time slots associated with 
the advanced Verify Task Schedule is ignored.</pre>
<p>Verify=basic is intended to be used with the auto-verify policy for RAID

basis.  Also, for this reason, in systems that support Basic Verify, 
auto-verify is set to ON by default.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When verify=basic, if you start a manual verify, it will start 
immediately. When verify=advanced, if you start a manual verify, it will 
follow the advanced Verify Task Schedule.  For more information, see

<dd>
<p>This command is associated with the stagger spin-up feature during hot-plug.
With stagger spin-up enabled (see command <strong>/cx set spinup</strong> and <strong>/cx set stagger</strong>),
during reset or power on, the controller will try to detect all drives that are 
present and spin them up staggered in time, allowing the spread of power consumption 
on the power supply.  Upon drive hot-plug, that is, <strong>not</strong> on power-on or reset, the 
default behavior of the system is automatic detection of the drives and immediate 
spin-up.  This command would change the default behavior and set the controller 
to spin-up as the system at power-on.</p>
<p>The <strong>autodetect=on|off</strong> attribute configures the controller drive auto-detect 
setting. It should be set to <em>off</em> to initiate the sequence for the stagger 
spin-up during hot-plug process.  After the drives are inserted or re-inserted to 
the ports (as specified in the second attribute decribed below), it should be set 
back to <em>on</em> to complete the configuration process for the controller to initiate 
the drive spin-up.</p>
<p>The <strong>disk=</strong><strong>&lt;p:-p</strong>&gt;<strong>|all</strong> attribute specifies one or many disks (i.e., drives 
or ports).  If a port is empty (i.e., no drive inserted), the echo message of the 
command refers to a port, and if there is already a drive inserted the message 
refers to a disk.  The example below shows that auto detect has been set to <em>off</em> 
to initiate stagger spin-up during hot-plug, where <em>port 3</em> was empty and 
<em>ports 5</em> and <em>6</em> had drives inserted.</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt;&gt; /c0 set autodetect=off disk=3:5-6
 Setting Auto-Detect on /c0 to [off] for port [3] and for disk [5,6]... Done</pre>
<p>If &quot;disk=all&quot;, then all of the drives or ports for that controller are specified.
for example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt;&gt; /c0 set autodetect=off disk=all
 Setting Auto-Detect on /c2 to [off] for all disks/ports... Done.</pre>
<p>To illustrate how the command is used, here is a usage scenario:</p>
<pre>
 1. Issue command (set autodetect=off) to disable automatic detection of the 
    ports for staggered spin-up.
 2. Pull out the drives of the specified ports (if not empty).
 3. Replace the drives previously removed at the ports specified.
 4. Issue command (set autodetect=on) to enable auto detect of the ports with
    the newly inserted drives.</pre>
<p>The above procedure would spin-up the newly inserted drives in a staggered manner.
Please note that the command takes longer to complete for ports that do not have 
drives inserted.</p>

<p>One application of this command is to see which sub-unit of a degraded unit has 
caused the unit to degrade and which disk within that sub-unit is the source of 
degradation.</p>
<p>The unit information table shows the percentage completion of the processes associated 
with the unit with <strong>%RCompl</strong> (percent Rebuild completion) and <strong>%V/I/M</strong> (percent 
Verifying, Initializing, or Migrating).</p>
<p>Unlike other array types, RAID-6 may potentially have 2 or more parity drives 
and can tolerate two or more failures within a unit.  As a result, an added 
notation is used to describe %RCompl and %V/I/M, and these are (A) and (P).
<strong>(A)</strong> denotes that the percentage completion is for the current 
active process, and <strong>(P)</strong> denotes that the percentage completion is for 
the current paused process.  For example:</p>
<pre>
 /localhost&gt; /c0 show unitstatus</pre>

<p>Here, the RAID-6 unit <em>u0</em> is in the Rebuild-Verify state, with percentage Rebuild 
completion of 50% and is the current active process.  The process of either 
Verifing, Initializing, or Migrating is at 70% and it is a paused process.</p>

<p>In the above example, the RAID-6 unit <em>u0</em> has 3 parity drives. Currently, 
it has two REBUILDING drives; one is in the active rebuilding state and 
another is in the paused rebuild state.  The unit is also in the paused 
VERIFY state. Like the output of the '/cx show unitstatus' command, the 
top-level unit status and percentage show the composite unit status and 
composite rebuild percentage.</p>

<p>This command allows you to turn on/off the autoverify operation on a specified
unit <em>/cx/ux</em>.  Once the autoverify=on, the RAID firmware will pick a time
to start the verify process on the unit.  If the allocated schedule windows is
enabled, the verify process becomes active during the scheduled windows.  Otherwise,
the firmware will decide when the verify needs to be paused or restarted again before
it completes.</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>show verify</strong> command to display the existing schedule
windows. The autoverify operation is a continuous verify operation, which takes
place within the existing schedule windows (displayed with /cx show verify) if
the schedule is enabled.  While the &quot;/cx show verify&quot; command allows
you to see the time for the verify operation, this command allows you to
enable or disable the autoverify operation on the specified unit.  This feature
only applies to 9000 models.</p>
<p>For a newly created unit on the 9650SE (with Release 9.5.1 or later), 9690SA, and
9750 controllers, autoverify is set to ON by default.  For earlier controller models, 
the default is OFF.</p>

<dd>
<p>This command allows you to set the read cache to either <strong>basic</strong>, 
<strong>intelligent</strong>, or <strong>off</strong> on a specified unit.</p>
<p><strong>Read Cache Basic</strong> is used to store data locally on the controller that 
has recently been written to media and is likely to be frequently accessed. 
This improves read access times for applications such as a database that 
can take advantage of storage caching. Read cache may be disabled without 
reducing performance for applications that are write intensive, or 
infrequently read back data recently written.</p>
<p><strong>Read Cache Intelligent</strong> enables the Intelligent Read Prefetch (IRP) feature.
This new feature includes a typical read ahead caching method, which is used 
to proactively retrieve data from media and store it locally on the controller 
with the anticipation that it may be requested by the host.  For example, the 
host may read blocks 1, 2, and 3.  With read-ahead caching, the controller will
also retrieve and hold in its cache blocks 4, 5, and 6 in anticipation of 
getting those command requests from the host.  By loading a larger set of data 
into the cache, chances are improved that another request can be filled by data
that is already in the cache.  This can be helpful with applications that are 
sequential in nature, such as video on demand, video surveillance playback, 
and restoring from a disk-to-disk backup.  Performance benefits of read-ahead 
are especially pronounced when the host queue depth is low.  In addition, 
read-ahead cache also improves sequential read performance when the unit is 
degraded.  The Intelligent Read Prefetch (IRP) feature also includes some 
intelligent and adaptive stream management layer to improve performance at 
higher queue depth in multiple read only or mixed read/write stream 
environments.  The performance improvements should be seen for most type of 
arrays and in any modes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If Intelligent mode is enabled, the features in Basic mode are also 
enabled.</p>
<p>The following table provides some recommendations for when to use each Read 
Cache setting.</p>

<dd>
<p>This command allows you to set the ignoreECC policy for a given unit such that during
rebuild of the specified unit, which could begin automatically (if the unit is
degraded and spare has been defined) or manually, to be applied to the rebuild operation.
Setting overwriteECC to on means ignoreECC. This feature only applies to

</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="string" class="item"><em>/cx/ux</em> <strong>set</strong> <em>name=string</em>    (9000 series)</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command allows you to name the unit to an arbitrary name upto 21 characters.  
No space is allowed within the string.  If user likes to use some special characters 
which the OS command shell reserves such as '&lt;', '&gt;', '!', and '&amp;', etc in the name 
string, the user has to use quote &quot;&quot; around the name string in order to bypass the 
command shell.  Users can use this 
name in conjunction with the unit serial number (which created at the unit creation 
time) to cross reference with the unit.  It is user's responsibility to give unique 
or redundant names on all units.  This feature only applies to 9000 models.</p>

<p>This command presents the queue policy of the firmware.  If the queue policy is
on, the firmware utilizes the drive queueing policy.  Some drives
do not support any queueing policy, this policy will have no effect on
those drives.</p>
<p>For a spare, drive queuing is not meaningful or applicable. For example, when a

<dd>
<p>This command sets the Rapid RAID Recovery policy for the specified unit.  
Rapid RAID Recovery can speed up the rebuild process, and it can speed up 
the initialize and verify tasks for redundant arrays in the RAID system 
upon the event of an unclean system shutdown. This feature allows for 
expedited boot-up time in the event of an unclean shutdown. Setting this 
option to all applies the policy to the rebuild, initialize and verify 
tasks at reboot. Setting it to rebuild applies the policy to the rebuild 
tasks only. If the policy is set to disable, then none of the tasks would 
be sped up.  (Note: In the command &quot;rapidrecovery&quot; may be abbreviated as 
&quot;rrr&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The default setting of Rapid RAID Recovery is 'all' for redundant
arrays.  For non-redundant arrays the default is disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a quiet option for setting the Rapid RAID Recovery policy
to disable.  The quiet option is provided for scripting purposes and is
applicable to the <em>disable</em> setting only.</p>

<dd>
<p>This command sets the storsave policy of the specified unit to be either protect, balance,
or perform when the unit write cache is enabled.</p>
<p>This feature is available for the 9550SX and higher model controllers only. There is
a tradeoff among the available settings.  The following description about the settings
should help you to decide which one is suitable for your applications.  The 
<em>protect</em> mode is the default setting.</p>
<p><strong>protect</strong> -- provides the maximum data protection among the controller settings.  
When user sets storsave to <em>protect</em>, it means:</p>
<p>1. &quot;Write Cache&quot; will be disabled when the unit becomes &quot;DEGRADED&quot;,</p>
<p>2. all data flushing from controller cache will be flushed to media, and</p>
<p>3. incoming FUA (Force Unit Access) host request will be ignored if a BBU is 
installed and enabled;  Otherwise, will be honored.</p>
<p><strong>perform</strong> -- provides the maximum performance and less data protection among the 
controller settings.  When user sets storsave to <em>perform</em>, it means:</p>
<p>1. &quot;Write Cache&quot; will not be disabled when the unit becomes &quot;DEGRADED&quot;,</p>
<p>2. all data flushing from controller cache will be flushed to disk, and</p>
<p>3. incoming FUA (Force Unit Access) host request will be honored.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When storsave is set to <em>perform</em>, a warning about data loss in the 
event of power failure is displayed, followed by a prompt to continue.  If you
want to skip the confirmation, use the [<em>quiet</em>] option to bypass.</p>
<p><strong>balance</strong> -- provides more data protection than perform mode but less data 
protection than protect mode, and provides better performance than protect 
mode but less performance than perform mode.  When user sets the storsave 
to <em>balance</em>, it means:</p>
<p>1. &quot;Write Cache&quot; will not be disabled when the unit becomes &quot;DEGRADED&quot;,</p>
<p>2. all data flushing from controller cache will be flushed to media if a 
BBU is installed and enabled; Otherwise, will be flushed to disk only, and</p>
<p>3. incoming FUA (Force Unit Access) host request will be ignored if a BBU is 
installed and enabled;  Otherwise, will be honored.</p>

<dd>
<p>This feature is only available with 9000 series of controllers.</p>
<p>This command allows you to migrate an existing unit (aka source) to a unit with 
<em>type=RaidType</em> (aka destination), to increase capacity, change the RAID level (with
the same or increased capacity), or change the stripe size.</p>
<p>The unit that results from the migration (destination unit) is subject to similar 
rules and policies that apply when creating a new unit.  For example, a valid number 
of disks and parameters must be specified.  The destination unit must use all source 
disks and potentially augment the number of disks in the <strong>disk=<em>p:-p</em></strong> disk list.  
Unspecified parameters are assigned default values (stripe size of 64K, write 
cache enabled, autoverify disabled, and ignoreECC disabled).</p>
<p>The unit to be migrated (source unit) must be in a normal state (not degraded, 
initializing, or rebuilding) before the migration.  If the source unit is of type 
RAID-1 and the destination unit is of type single, the disk-specifier of the 
migration command [disk=<em>p:-p</em>] is actually not optional and must <strong>not</strong> be included 
in the command.  The drives in the RAID-1 array would become multiple units of type 
single after the migration, and the source drives are the destination drives.  
Specifying more drives with the &quot;disk=&quot; option would return an error.</p>
<p>Both source unit name and serial number will be carried over to the destination 
unit.  However, the RAID-1 to single migration path is a special case.  In this case, 
the <strong>migrate</strong> command splits both drives into two identical single disks.  The 
source unit name will be duplicated on the destination units, or single disks,  
but the source unit serial number will <strong>not</strong> be carried over to new unit.  The 
new destination unit will have its own serial number.</p>
<p><strong>type=RaidType</strong> consists of the destination unit RAID type as in <strong>raid0</strong>, <strong>raid1</strong>, 
<strong>raid5</strong>, <strong>raid10</strong>, <strong>raid50</strong>, <strong>raid6</strong>, or <strong>single</strong>.</p>
<p>For example &quot;type=raid5&quot; indicates the destination unit is RAID-5.</p>
<p>The following table illustrates valid migration paths:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  You can only migrate a unit to a RAID level that has the same or larger
capacity as the exisiting one.  A four-drive RAID-5 unit can migrate to a four-drive
RAID-0, but a four-drive RAID-0 unit cannot migrate to a four-drive RAID-5, without
adding another drive, due to the need for additional storage capacity for parity bits.</p>
<p><strong>disk=p:-p</strong> consists of a list of ports or vports (disks) to be used in addition 
to the source disks in the construction of the destination unit. One or more ports 
can be specified. Multiple ports can be specified using <strong>&quot;:&quot;</strong> or <strong>&quot;-&quot;</strong> as port 
index separators.  A dash indicates a range and can be mixed with &quot;:&quot;. For example
<strong>disk=0:1:2-5:9:12</strong> indicates port 0, 1, 2 thru 5 (inclusive), 9 and 12.</p>
<p><strong>group=3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16</strong> is <strong>only</strong> applicable to <strong>type=raid50</strong> 
which consists of a number of disks per group.  Recall that a RAID-50 is a multi-tier 
array. At the most bottom layer, N number of disks per group are used to form the 
RAID-5 layer.  These RAID-5 arrays are then integrated into a RAID-0. This option 
allows you to specify the number of disks in the RAID-5 level. Valid values are 3, 
4, 5 and 6.  For example <strong>group=3</strong> indicates 3 disks of RAID-5 at the bottom layer
of RAID-50.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can have a maximum of 4 subunits in a RAID-50 unit.</p>
<p>Note that a sufficient number of disks are required for a given pattern or disk
group. For example, given 6 disks, specifying 3 will create two RAID-5.  However
given 12 disks, specifying 3 will create four RAID-5 under the RAID-0 level.  Given
6 disks and grouping of 6 is not allowed, as you'll basically be creating a RAID-5.</p>
<p>The default disk <strong>group</strong> varies based on number of disks. For 6 &amp; 9 disks, default
is group=3.  For 8 disks, default is group=4. For 10 or 15 disks, default is
group=5.  For 12 or 16 disks, default is group=4.  For 14 disks, default is
group=7.  Case of 12 disks could be grouped with group=3, group=4, or group=6.
Group=4 was set by default as it provides best net capacity and performance.
Case of 15 disks could be grouped with group=3 or group=5.  And case
of 16 disks could be grouped with group=4 and group=8.</p>
<p>Note that RAID-10 always has <strong>group=2</strong>, so an attribute specifying its group is 
not necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Stripe</strong> consists of the logical unit stripe size to be used.  The following table 
illustrates the supported and applicable stripes on the respective unit types and 
controller models. Stripe size units are in KB (kilobytes).</p>

<p><strong>noscan</strong> instructs CLI not to notify the operating system (OS) about the 
creation of the new unit.  By default CLI will inform the OS. One application 
of this feature is to prevent the OS from creating block special devices such 
as /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc as some implementations might create naming fragmentation 
and a moving target.</p>
<p><strong>nocache</strong> instructs CLI to disable the write cache on the migrated 
unit.  Enabling write cache increases performance, but at the cost of potential
data loss in the event of sudden power loss (unless a BBU or UPS is installed).
By default the cache is enabled.  Unless there is a BBU or UPS installed, to 
avoid the possibility of data loss in the event of sudden power loss, it is 
recommended that <strong>nocache</strong> be specified.</p>
<p><strong>autoverify</strong> enables the autoverify attribute on the unit to be 
migrated. For more details on this feature, refer to <a href="#cx_ux_set_autoverify">cx/ux set autoverify</a>
section of this document.</p>
<p><strong><em>Migration Process.</em></strong>  In all cases of migration, the background migration process
must be completed before the newly sized unit is available for use.  You can continue
using the original unit during this time.  Once the migration is finished, a reboot 
will be required if you are booted from the unit.  For secondary storage, depending 
on your operating system, you may need to first unmount the unit, then use CLI to 
'remove' and 'rescan' the unit so that the operating system can see the new capacity,
and then remount the unit.</p>
<p>You may also need to resize the file system or add a new partition.  For instructions, 
consult the documentation for your operating system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:  It is important that you allow migration to complete before adding drives
to the unit or move it to another controller.  Making any physical changes to the 
unit during migration may cause the migration to stop, and can jeopardize the safety
of your data.</p>
<p><strong><em>Examples.</em></strong>  The two examples which follow show the usage of this command for
splitting a mirror and for capacity expansion, respectively.  Following those are
sample outputs of the migrate function.  After which example outputs showing the
special case are presented.</p>
<p>Example of split mirror:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c1/u3 migrate type=single
 Sending migration message to /c1/u3 ... Done.</pre>
<p>The source unit u3 is a TWINSTOR or RAID-1, using the <strong>migrate</strong> command splits u3 to u3 
and u<em>x</em>, each with the RAID type of Single.</p>
<p>Example of capacity expansion:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c0/u3 migrate type=raid10 disk=10-11 stripe=16
 Sending migration message to /c0/u3 ... Done.</pre>
<p>The source unit is u3 and the destination unit is RAID-10 with disks 10 and 11 in 
addition to the disks in the existing unit u3.</p>
<p>The following is an example of how migrating units are displayed.  In this example, 
the set of reports indicate that /c0/u3 is a migrating unit with 39% completion.  The
&quot;/c0/u3 show&quot; command shows that the source unit is <em>su3</em> and is of type RAID-1, and
the destination unit <em>du3</em> is of type RAID-10.</p>

<p>Please note that the migration path of raidtype Single to RAID-1 is a special 
case.  Since the single unit would become a mirrored array, technically this 
is not a migration.  As a result this command shows a different status than
other migration paths.  In addition, the status of the newly specified disk 
would show DEGRADED until the &quot;migration&quot; is complete.</p>
<p>For example, below is a system with two migrating units, /c0/u0 and /c0/u1.  
u0 is migrating from a RAID-10 to a RAID-0 array, while u1 is migrating from 
Single to a RAID-1, initiated by the following commands:</p>
<pre>
 /c0/u0 migrate type=raid0</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>
 /c0/u1 migrate type=raid1 disk=5</pre>
<p>Note the difference in 'UnitType' and 'Status' of u0 and u1, even though they 
are both migrating units.</p>

this command could be used to get most recent data about the presence of a disk. Be 
aware that extracting SMART data will burden the I/O bandwidth.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> SMART data is applicable for SATA drives only.  Therefore, a request
for SMART data for a SAS drive (as with the 9690SA and 9750 controllers) would 
result in an error response.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For SAS drives, drive attributes that could be extracted from SMART 
data is available with the following commands:</p>
<pre>
 /cx/px show temperature
 /cx/px show spindlespd 
 /cx/px show rasect
 /cx/px show pohrs</pre>
<p>for temperature, spindle speed, reallocated sectors, and power-on hours, 
respectively.  You may also use '<em>/cx/px show all</em>' for all of the drive 
attributes.</p>

<dd>
<p>This command allows you to remove (or export) a port <strong>/cx/px</strong> (or drive). 
Exporting a port will instruct the firmware to remove the specified port
from its pool of managed ports, but retains the DCB (Disk Configuration Block)
meta-data on the attached disk.  You can import (or re-introduce) the port
via the <strong>rescan</strong> command. Use <em>noscan</em> to bypass informing the OS of this 
change. Default is to inform the OS.  The quiet option is for the non-interactive 
mode.</p>
<p>Use caution when using this command.  Drives, which are part of a redundant
array, can be removed,  but the array will be degraded.  Non-redundant drives, 
which are part of a unit, can not be removed.</p>

The optional 'type' in the command specifies which set of statistics data would be 
cleared. The options are either: <strong>ra</strong> for Running Average, <strong>lct</strong> for Long 
Command Times,and <strong>ext</strong> for Extended Drive Statistics.  More detailed information 
regarding these statistics and the Drive Performance Monitor is available in the 
<strong>Features</strong> section under 'Drive Performance Monitor'.</p>
<p>Please note that if type=ra, both the Running Average and Histogram data are
cleared.  If type=lct, only the Long Command Times data would be cleared.  
And if type=ext, the extended drive statistics are cleared.  If no type is
specified, the default is the same as type=ra.</p>

<dd>
<p>This command starts the battery capacity test.  The test may take up to 24 hours
to complete.  During the test, the BBU is <strong>not</strong> capable of backup operation
and the write cache is disabled.  The performance of all units under the
controller may be impacted because their write IOs are not cached.  Once the test 
is completed with no error and the BBU returns back to OK state, the write cache
will be resumed.  The quiet option is for non-interactive mode.</p>

<h2><a name="enclosure_object_messages">Enclosure Object Messages</a></h2>
<p>Enclosure Object Messages are commands (a.k.a. methods/messages) that are sent to an
instance of an enclosure such as e0.  The enclosure element object messages are 
commands sent to an instance of the enclosure element such as fan0.  The subsections
which follow describe the commands of the enclosure and the enclosure elements.  The
latter includes commands for the slot, fan, temperature sensor, and power supply 
elements.</p>
<p>The command descriptions and examples of this section are shown with the syntax 
of the controller object pre-pended to the enclosure object (i.e., /cx/ex).
For systems with the 9650SE controller or CCU enclosure, simply drop the pre-pended 
controller name in the command, as, not '/c1/e0' but '/e0'.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the supported controllers,  protocols, 
configurations, and enclosure elements.</p>

<p>This command allows you to download a specified expander firmware image to the 
target SEP (Storage Enclosure Processor) expander that supports the SES-2 
(SCSI Enclosure Services) standard for enclosure management.  (CCU enclosures 
with SAF-TE protocol are not supported.)</p>
<p>This command is for the 9690SA and 9750 controllers with Release 10.2 or later only.</p>
<p>The <strong>fw=filename_with_path</strong> attribute allows you to specify the firmware image file 
name along with its path. Please note that <em>filename_with_path</em> could not have 
spaces (as Windows allows).</p>
<p>The firmware image specified by <em>filename_with_path</em> will be validated and examined 
for version difference. If the image is valid a subsequent message will indicate 
the detected version difference, along with a table showing the SEP number and the 
firmware versions.  You are then asked with a prompt to continue.  If you enter &quot;y&quot;,
the download process will initiate.</p>
<p>The <strong>sep=n</strong> attribute is optional.  It identifies the target SEP expander in the 
system.  Valid range is {0..9}.  Without it being specified, the default which is 
0 (zero), will be used.</p>
<p>The <strong>force</strong> attribute is optional. With it the warning message, version check, and 
prompt to proceed are all bypassed.  The image will initiate the download immediately.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT! Please note the following regarding usage of this command.</strong></p>
<p>1) The expander models that are supported with this command are indicated in a 
compatibility list for your reference.  Only expander models in this list are supported.  
Please refer to: <a href="http://www.lsi.com/channel/support/marketing_resources/index.html">http://www.lsi.com/channel/support/marketing_resources/index.html</a>.
Click on the <em>Data and Interoperability</em> tab, and then click on the <em>3ware 
Interoperability Information</em> link to check if your expander is supported.</p>
<p>2) Please make sure there is no I/O activity between the controller and the target 
expander during the download process.  For example, be sure to unmount any mounted 
volumes, or stop any background tasks that may be running and do not start or 
schedule any background tasks such as rebuilds or verifies with the units or drives 
in the target expander during the time of download.</p>
<p>3) The expander requires reboot for the new firmware image to take effect.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
   //localhost&gt; /c1/e0 update fw=c:\tmp\Badger_0314.esm</pre>
<pre>
   Warning: Updating firmware that is incompatible with your device can
   render the device unusable.  Before you update the firmware, it is
   recommended that you:</pre>
<pre>
   1) Backup your data.</pre>
<pre>
   2) Verify with your enclosure vendor that you have the correct image.</pre>
<pre>
   3) Have a copy of the existing expander firmware image so that
   you can roll back, if necessary.</pre>
<pre>
   4) Make sure there is no I/O activity between the controller and
   the target expander (see instructions in user documentation).</pre>

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="cx_ex_pwrsx_show2" class="item"><em>/cx/ex/pwrsx</em> <strong>show</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command shows information about the specified enclosure alarm. The possible 
status values are OK, FAIL, NOT-INSTALLED, and ACTIVATED.  The status values 
are described below.  The possible values for State are ON and OFF.  The possible 
values for Audibility are UNMUTE and MUTE.</p>
<p>Possible Status values:</p>
<pre>
 OK - Alarm device is functional and operational.
 FAIL - Alarm device has malfunctioned and is not operational.
 NOT-INSTALLED - Alarm device has not been installed.
 ACTIVATED - Alarm device is functional, and an error condition has been detected. 
 This is a visual indication for the alarm, in the event that it may be muted.</pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c0/e0/alm0 show</pre>
<pre>
 Alarm       Status         State      Audibility   
 ---------------------------------------------------          
 alm0        OK             OFF        UNMUTE</pre>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="cx_ex_almx_set_alarm_mute_unmute_off" class="item"><em>/cx/ex/almx</em> <strong>set</strong> <em>alarm=&lt;mute|unmute|off</em>&gt;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This command controls the audibility and state of the enclosure alarm. It provides 
the ability to silence the alarm after it has been turned on.  It also gives you 
the option to mute or unmute the alarm setting.  In the case where a known 
condition would set off the alarm and you do not wish to hear the sound of the 
alarm, this command could be used to mute the potential audible alarm.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  Some enclosures support alarms but not the mute/unmute function.  For 
these enclosures, the command to set the alarm to <em>mute</em> will return an error 
message indicating that the feature is not supported.  In this case, the alarm 
setting of <em>unmute</em> would seem to be supported.  This is because the <em>unmute</em> 
setting is the default and as such there is no error response.  In effect, for 
these enclosures, the alarm is not mutable and would stay unmute
.
Example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c0/e0/alm0 set alarm=unmute
 Setting alarm audibility setting of /c0/e0/alm0 to [unmute] ... Done.</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You <em>cannot</em> turn ON the alarm.  The alarm is turned on by firmware when 
it detects a degraded state pertaining to a drive or array.  Setting the alarm 
to ON will return an error.</p>
<p>If an error condition or degraded state has been detected, the enclosure alarm 
or buzzer would be audible.  To silence the alarm you may set the state of the 
alarm to OFF.  You could also mute the alarm.  The difference between using 
either is the following:</p>
<pre>

 State or Audibility    Persistence across reboot 
 -------------------    -------------------------
 ON/OFF                 Yes 
 MUTE/UNMUTE            No</pre>
<p>For OFF, after you reboot, the alarm will sound as long as the system is 
still in a degraded state (i.e., the alarm is persistent across reboot).</p>
<p>For MUTE, after you reboot, the alarm will no longer sound even though the 
system is still in a degraded state (i.e., the alarm would not appear persistent 
across reboot).</p>
<p>For enclosures that do not support MUTE, there is no difference between OFF 
and MUTE.</p>
<p>The default values are UNMUTE and OFF.</p>

  (2) 'nordcache' is an override to the read cache default; use to
      disable the read cache.  For Read Cache Basic use rdcachebasic.
      Read Cache is supported in the 9650SE or newer controllers with
      Release 9.5.2 or later.
  (3) 'rebuildmode' and 'verifymode' are supported in the 9650SE or newer

  (1) 'nowrcache' and 'nocache' disable the write cache and they behave
      identically.
  (2) 'nordcache' is an override to the read cache default; use to
      disable the read cache.  For Read Cache Basic use rdcachebasic.
      Read Cache is supported in the 9650SE or newer controllers with
      Release 9.5.2 or later.
  (3) 'rebuildmode' and 'verifymode' are supported in the 9650SE or newer
      controllers with Release 9.5.2 or later.
  (4) '/cx show phy' is supported in the 9650SE or newer controllers
      with Release 9.5.2 or later.</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Help stops at this /Object/Command level.  Help does not extend to the
Attribute level, and thus inquiry for /Object/Command/Attribute is not valid.  
For example, 'help /cx add verify' is not a valid Help command string and the
system would respond with a list of all '/cx add' commands followed by an
error message.</p>
<p>An alternate way to use Help is with '?' or 'help' at the end of a command 
string.  That is, starting with the object, followed by the command, followed by '?' or 
'help'.  For example, '/c0' being our object and 'show' is our command:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c0 show ?
  /cx show
  /cx show Attribute [Attribute ...]           where Attribute is:
           allunitstatus|bios|firmware|driver|drivestatus|exportjbod|
           autocarve(9550SX and higher)|autorebuild(9550SX and higher)|

  /cx show all          where all means Attributes and configurations.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Again, Help stops at the command keyword level, so that
'/c0 show selftest help' or '/c0 show phy ?' would respond with an output
identical to <strong>/c0 show phy</strong> followed by <strong>/c0 show ?</strong>.  In this case no
error follows.  Please also note that if /c0 is not a valid controller in
your system, an error is generated and this way of using help would not
work.  Instead you will get the following:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c4 show ?
 Error: (CLI:003) Specified controller does not exist.</pre>

<h1><a name="command_logging">Command Logging</a></h1>
<p>CLI has a logging function that makes an entry into a log file for each command
line that makes a change to the controller configuration (for example, 
add/delete units).  Both CLI and 3DM2 has this logging function and it is 
enabled by default.</p>
<p>Setting the environment variable to ON or OFF will enable or disable the 
logging function, respectively.  The environment variable is TW_CLI_LOG, and 
the method for setting it depends on the operating system.</p>
<p>The sections and examples below show the log command syntax and the log file 
location depending on the operating system.  Note where ON is indicated, OFF 
may be substituted.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="setting_of_environment_variable" class="item">Setting of Environment Variable:</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>For <strong>Linux</strong>, <strong>FreeBSD</strong>, <strong>Mac OS</strong>, and <strong>OpenSolaris</strong>, the command depends 
on the type of shell:</p>
<pre>
    If bash, ksh, or sh, use &quot;export TW_CLI_LOG=ON&quot;
    If csh, use &quot;setenv TW_CLI_LOG ON&quot;</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The shell that you are running CLI must be the same shell that you 
input the command to set the environment variable.</p>
<p>For <strong>Windows</strong>, set the environment variable by clicking on the <strong>start</strong> button
and then right-clicking on <strong>My Computer</strong> and selecting <strong>Properties</strong>.  In 
Properties, click on the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.  Then click on the <strong>Environment 
Variables</strong> button.  If you don't see TW_CLI_LOG you may add and set it to ON
of OFF by clicking on <strong>New</strong>, (or edit an existing one by clicking on <strong>Edit</strong>).</p>
<p>Since the default of Command Logging is ON, if you wish the turn it off, you 
could set the environment variable TW_CLI_LOG to OFF.</p>
<p>When you cycle power your system, the new environment variable is recorded by 
Windows and read by CLI upon system startup, after which CLI will stop logging 
any new commands associated with the controller.</p>

<h1><a name="features">Features</a></h1>
<p>This section lists some of the features that CLI supports for the 3ware RAID
product.  While many system features require a few commands, some require or 
involve a set of commands that work together.  Also, some of these features 
may be compenhensively more complex to described in a few discreet commands.  
The purpose of this section is to provide an encapsulated view of selected
system features with their command set.</p>
<p>Please note that you could consult the <em>3ware SAS/SATA RAID Software User Guide</em>
for more in-depth conceptual information about features that can be used to 
control your 3ware RAID controller as well.</p>

<h2><a name="drive_performance_monitor">Drive Performance Monitor</a></h2>
<p>Performance monitoring and statistics of the RAID controller, as a basis 
for analysis of performance, may also provide information for qualification 
and diagnostics. The Drive Performance Monitor of CLI supports statistics of
queue depths, IOPs, transfer rate, response time for reads/writes, and 
command reads/writes.</p>
<p>Queue depth refers to the number of reads/writes currently outstanding, 
IOPs refers to the number of reads/writes completing, transfer rate refers 
to the number of sectors read/written, response time refers to the 
execution time of all commands, and command read/writes refers to the 
drive and drive sectors' accumlated read and write commands.</p>
<p>The types of drive performance statistics supported are organized into five 
groups:</p>
<pre>
 - instantaneous
 - running average
 - long command times
 - response histogram
 - extended drive statistics</pre>
<p>The instantaneous measurements provide a short duration average. The running 
average is a measure of long-term averages that smooth out the data, and 
results in older results fading from the average over time. The long command 
times is a collection of the commands with the longest read/write 
response time.  The response histogram categorizes the read/write execution 
times and group them together based on time frames. Finally, the extended
drive statistics refers to statistics of a drive's read commands, write 
commands, write commands with FUA (Force Unit Access), flush commands, and 
a drive sectors's read, write, and write commands with FUA.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This feature is for the 9550SX and higher model controllers, with 
exception of the commands related to extended drive statistics, that are 
supported on the 9650SE, 9690SA and 9750 controllers only.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATION</strong></p>
<p>The command syntax falls into three categories: 1) Configuration, 2) port-based 
drive statistics, and 3) controller-based drive statistics summary. The 
configuration category allows the user to see the settings as well as change them. 
At this time, the only setting that the user can change is 'enable' or 'disable'
of the Drive Performance Monitor. The port-based 'show' commands provide 
requested statistics based on type. The port-based 'set' command clears the 
specified type statistics. While these commands require the specification of 
the port each time, the controller-based commands do not and provide the 
information in a summary format.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please note that the keyword 'pmstat' and 'dpmstat' generate the same 
system response.  At this time both could be used for Drive Performance Monitor
statistics.  In the future if other types of performance monitor support would
be added, 'pmstat' would denote Performance Monitor while 'dpmstat' would 
refer to Drive performance statistics only.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the drive performance monitor commands. The command 
type, command syntax, and corresponding descriptions are listed. Following the 
table is an important note, which is then followed by examples and usage of the 
commands.</p>

 --------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The command '/cx show dpmstat' shows the performance monitor 
configuration and the default set of summary statistics (type=inst) shows data 
regardless of whether the performance monitor setting is ON or OFF. If the setting 
is ON and I/O is running, the statistics data will change over time because the 
measurements are being averaged. If the setting is OFF, the same table layout is 
shown. However, since no calculations are taking place, the data will be static 
and remains unchanged. Thus, when the drive performance monitor is OFF, the data 
shown may not be zeros.</p>
<p>Examples of the command's usage are shown below.</p>
<p>To display the configuration of the Drive Performance Monitor of the specified 
controller (default statistics display is instantaneous data), use command 
<strong>/cx show dpmstat</strong>. For example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c0 show dpmstat

<p>In the configuration information above, 'Version' refers to the firmware version
of the Performance Monitor, 'Max commands for averaging' refers to the maximum number of 
commands that can be saved and used for calculating the average, and 'Max latency
commands to save' refers to the maximum number of commands with high latency that 
are saved.  The number of elements in the buffer is determined by these configurations 
and the memory constraints of the system.</p>
<p>To set the Drive Performance Monitor to 'enable' or 'disable', use commands 
<strong>/cx set dpmstat=on</strong> and <strong>/cx set dpmstat=off</strong>, respectively.
For example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c0 set dpmstat=off
 Setting Drive Performance Monitoring on /c0 to [off]... Done.</pre>
<p>To display the running average statistics data at the controller
level, i.e., as a summary of the running average data for the set of 
drives attached to the controller, use command <strong>/cx show dpmstat type=ra</strong>.  
For example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c0 show dpmstat type=ra

<p>Note that there is a set of 38 'Bins' and each bin denotes a Response Time 
category.  The number of I/Os or commands that fall into the Response Time 
time range of the designated bin would fall into that bin.  In the display 
above, there are no commands with response times of 10 milliseconds or 
shorter, and there are 204 commands with 20 milliseconds.  Note that for 
the I/O application and activities to this drive, the concentration of the 
longer response times is toward the middle, as in a statistical Normal Curve.</p>
<p>To clear the running average statistics data of the specified port, 
use command <strong>/cx/px set dpmstat=clear type=ra</strong>.  For example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c0/p3 set dpmstat=clear type=ra
 Clearing Port Performance Monitor running average statistics on /c0/p3... Done.</pre>
<p>Please note that this clears the Running Average and Histogram data.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Usage of the 'clear' command without specifying 'type' implies 
the default, which is 'type=ra'.  The default thus effectively clears 
both the running average statistics and histogram data.  Also, some statistics 
data types cannot be cleared, such as setting 'type=inst' or 'type=histdata'.
Attempting to clear these will return an error.</p>
<p>If I/O traffic to the drive has been stopped, after clearing, a
subsequent request to show the running average statistics        
would show, for example:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c0/p3 show dpmstat type=ra</pre>

<h2><a name="rapid_raid_recovery">Rapid RAID Recovery</a></h2>
<p>Rapid RAID Recovery can speed up the rebuild, initialize, and verify processes
and tasks in response to an unclean system shutdown.  Effectively this feature 
provides for expedited boot-up time.</p>
<p>This feature is supported on the 9750, 9690SA and 9650SE (with supporting firmware) 
controllers.  Also, it is only supported on redundant arrays only, such as RAID-1, 
RAID-5, RAID-6, RAID-10 and RAID-50.  This feature is not supported over migration.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATION</strong></p>
<p>The usage of this feature consists of a set of commands that sets 
the feature to one of three possible states.  This configuration may be 
defined at unit creation time or after a unit has been created.  Below 
is a summary of the commands for this feature.</p>
<pre>
 /cx add ... rapidrecovery=all|rebuild|disable
 /cx/ux set rapidrecovery=all|rebuild|disable [quiet]
 /cx/ux show rapidrecovery</pre>
<p>If you set this option to <strong>all</strong>, upon an unclean system shutdown, the 
Rapid RAID Recovery policy will apply to rebuild, initialize, and verify tasks at 
reboot.  If you set this option to <strong>rebuild</strong>, then only the rebuild task will 
be applied. If you set it to <strong>disable</strong>, then none of the tasks will be sped up.
Please note that once this attribute is set for the unit, the policy setting 
is persistent in the system until it is disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once the Rapid RAID Recovery has been &quot;disabled&quot; for a unit, it 
cannot be changed again for that unit.  As a result, if you issue the 
'/cx/px set rapidrecovery=disable' command, a message along with a prompt for 
input to proceed will appear.  To turn off the message and prompt
for scripting purposes, use the quiet option.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The default setting of Rapid RAID Recovery is 'all' for redundant
arrays.  For non-redundant arrays the default is disabled.</p>
<p>Consider a 9690SA controller with four drives attached. Creating a RAID-5 
unit with the rapidrecovery attribute set to the <strong>all</strong> option:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c1 add type=raid5 disk=0:2:3 rapidrecovery=all</pre>
<pre>
 Creating new unit on controller /c1 ... Done. The new unit is /c1/u0.
 Setting AutoVerify=ON for the new unit ... Done.
 Setting Rapid RAID Recovery policy on /c1/u0 to [all] ... Done.
 Setting default Command Queuing Policy for unit /c1/u0 to [on] ... Done.
 Setting write cache=ON for the new unit ... Done.
 Warning: You do not have a battery backup unit for /c1/u0 and the enabled
 write cache (default) may cause data loss in the event of power failure.</pre>
<p>Subsequent inquiry of the controller and unit information would show:</p>

<h2><a name="user_defined_lun_sizing">User Defined LUN Sizing</a></h2>
<p>User Defined LUN Sizing, or, Variable LUN Carve, is a feature that allows
the user to specify variable sizes for volumes in a unit.  The first volume
may be considered, although not necessarily, the Boot LUN.  This feature
allows the user to specify up to four volumes or LUNs in a unit.</p>
<p>You can define the LUN sizes for these array types: RAID-0, RAID-1, 
RAID-10, RAID-5, RAID-50, RAID-6 and Single.</p>
<p>To specify Variable LUN Carve simply requires setting an attribute during unit 
creation.  However, to eliminate potential confusion with the existing
autocarve and carvesize commands, this section was created to describe
this feature along with those commands.</p>
<p>If the pre-existing related commands are included, the set of LUN carve 
commands are the following:</p>
<pre>
 /cx add ... [v0=n|vol=a:b:c:d]
 /cx show autocarve
 /cx show carvesize
 /cx set autocarve=on|off
 /cx set carvesize=[1024..32768]</pre>
<p>Note that the first command associates with this feature, and the latter 
four commands have pre-existed.</p>
<p>While the Variable LUN Sizing feature is related to the autocarve feature, 
they are independent.  If autocarve has been set to ON, then the sizes of 
the volumes for that unit are set to the specifed carve-size (or the 
default).  The possible size of the carving is in the range of 
{1024..32768} GB or {1..32} TB. Specifying the size(s) of the boot or 
first four volumes in essense overlays these volumes with their respective
sizes to that of the carved volume sizes.  For example, if the carvesize 
has been set to 1024GB and autocarve is ON:</p>
<p>Autocarve=ON, carvesize=1024GB (1TB)</p>
<pre>
   ------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------
    1024   1024   1024   1024   1024   1024   1024   1024   1024   1024   . . .
   ------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------</pre>
<p>If we specify the first four LUN volumes to be 2000GB, 500GB, 1024GB, and 700GB,
then we have the following:</p>
<pre>
   ------------+---+------+----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+-------
       2000     500  1024  700   896   1024   1024   1024   1024   1024   . . . 
   ------------+---+------+----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+-------</pre>
<p>All numbers are in units of GB.  Note the while the last specified carved size 
was 700GB, the next carved volume is not 1024GB but,</p>
<pre>
   1024GB - (remainder of last volume carved)</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>
   1024 - 128 = 896</pre>
<p>The remainder of the last volume is 128GB because the four specified volumes
totaled 4224GB which exceeds the four autocarved volumes totalling 4096GB 
by 128GB.</p>
<p>For the add command, at unit creation time the volume sizes could be 
specified with either the attribute <strong>v0=</strong> or <strong>vol=</strong>.  With <strong>v0</strong> only
the first LUN volume size could be specified.  With <strong>vol</strong>, up to four LUN
volume sizes may be specified.  The input of size is an integer in 
gigabytes (GB) and the valid range is [1..32768], the upper limit is 32TB.</p>
<p>If the <strong>vol=a:b:c:d</strong> attribute is used, each volume is separated by the 
symbol <strong>:</strong> in ascending order. That is, the integer closest to <strong>=</strong> is 
volume 0 (v0), followed by volume 1 (v1), volume 2 (v2), etc.  The maximum 
that could be specified with this method is four volumes, or, up to v3.</p>
<p>For example, consider an 8-port controller with four drives attached.  As 
in the following:</p>

<h2><a name="verify">Verify</a></h2>
<p>The Verify function is among other self-test functions such as Rebuild and 
Selftest in the RAID system.  It performs data integraty checks on an array 
unit based on the unit type.  For a RAID-1 array, for example, the verification 
involves checking that both drives contain the exact data; and on a RAID-5 
array, the parity information is used to verify data integrity.</p>
<p>This feature is available on 9000 series controllers. The Verify function
requires some initial setup.  Particularly the scheduled time windows of 
the background verify tasks need to be defined.  A scheduled time window, 
or, timeslot, is part of the Verify Schedule.</p>
<p><strong>SET UP</strong></p>
<p>For the <strong>Verify</strong> function, the following commands are used for the 
set up:</p>
<pre>
 /cx set verify=enable|disable|1..5
 /cx add verify=ddd:hh:duration
 /cx del verify=slot_id</pre>
<p>The setup consists of setting Verify to enable, then adding verify 
timeslots into the Schedule.  The Schedule contains a default set of verify
timeslots defined, so specifying the verify timeslots is not necessary if
the defaults are suitable.</p>
<p>When a verify background process would initiate and run depends on more 
than the Schedule itself.  The sections below describe this in more detail.</p>
<p><strong>AUTOVERIFY</strong></p>
<p>Related to this Verify function is <strong>autoverify</strong>.  The Autoverify setting lets
the RAID firmware determine a time to start the verify process of a unit 
automatically or at its discretion at a time suitable (but related to the 
Schedule) when it is set to ON.  If a verify process has started and the verify 
task cannot complete within the scheduled window, the verify task would be 
paused and resumed later.  Again, firmware makes its decision autonomously 
based on factors such as the schedule, settings, and other higher priority 
background tasks.</p>
<p>Autoverify applies to 9000 series controllers also.</p>
<p>The commands associated with Autoverify are the following:</p>
<pre>
 - /cx/ux set autoverify=on|off
 - /cx/ux show autoverify</pre>
<p>Autoverify is also an attribute that could be set at unit creation.  The
setting of autoverify is ON if Basic Verify (see <strong>Verify - Basic</strong> section)
is supported, otherwise the default is set to OFF.</p>
<p><strong>MANUAL VERIFY</strong></p>
<p>Also related to the Verify function is Manual verify, where a background
verify process or task for a unit could be started and stopped manually.  
The following is the set of commands associated with this:</p>
<pre>
 /cx/ux start verify
 /cx/ux stop verify</pre>
<p>Note that if subsequent to this command, one enables the background verify 
task to follow the scheduled slots, then this on-demand task will be paused 
until the next scheduled timeslot.</p>
<p><strong>VERIFY STATUS</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to see the status of the tasks associated with the Verify function,
the set of commands for that is the following:</p>
<pre>
 show verify
 /cx show verify
 /cx/ux show verifystatus
 /cx/ux show autoverify</pre>
<p>Here is an example of the show verify command.</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c2 show verify</pre>

 7       Fri     6:00pm           1 hr(s)        enabled</pre>
<p>For other examples of the Verify commands, please see the <strong>Primary Command
Syntax</strong> section of this document.</p>
<p>Since these set of commands are related but serve different functions with 
respect to Verify, how they work together determines when a background verify 
process would initiate and run.  Thus it is important to note their interactions.  
The following table summarizes the setting parameters and corresponding system 
response relative to the Verify function and when a verify task may run.</p>

 -------------+----------------------+------------------------+------------------------</pre>
<p>Please note that the command <em>/cx/ux start verify</em> is associated with Manual Verify 
only when Verify=Disable. When Verify=Enable, it does not necessarily start the 
verify task immediately.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="verify___advanced">Verify - Advanced</a></h2>
<p>Advanced Verify is actually the Verify function of the previous section, intended
for advanced users, in systems where Basic Verify is supported.  Advanced/Basic 
Verify is supported on 9650SE and 9690SA controllers.  In such systems, to set 
to Advanced Verify as opposed to Basic Verify, you would set verify=advanced 
with the command:</p>
<pre>
 /cx set verify=advanced|basic|1..5</pre>
<p>If the system does not support Advanced/Basic Verify, you would get the following 
error:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c2 set verify=advanced
 Error: (CLI:146) Basic/Advanced Verify is not supported.</pre>
<p>In this case you could still set Verify to enable/disable.  (See previous section.)
If Advanced/Basic is supported on your system, after issuing this command, all other 
commands for Advanced Verify is identical to Verify that was presented in the previous 
section.</p>
<p>We will show a setup scenario to demonstrate how the commands are used with respect 
to this feature.  For a RAID system with the following arrays and drives, we will 
show the usage of the commands along with examples.  Please note that this system
has a 9690SA controller with the firmware that also supports Basic Verify.</p>

<p>Please note that this is the lower part of the table in the previous section on Verify,
with verify=advanced instead of verify=enabled.</p>

</p>
<h2><a name="verify___basic">Verify - Basic</a></h2>
<p>As a result of the complexity and non-deterministic nature of Verify or 
Advanced Verify with respect to when scheduled verify tasks may execute, the
Basic Verify feature was introduced to provide a more simplistic verify 
function as an option.</p>
<p>Basic Verify does not change the current Verify function. But supplies the 
user a means to specify a preferred day and time for a weekly background verify 
task to be executed.  If the preferred day and time is not specified, a default
is provided.  The setting is simplier and when a scheduled verify task would 
run is more deterministic and straight-forward.</p>
<p>Before using Basic Verify, it is important to know if your system supports
Advanced/Basic Verify.  Generally, this is supported in the 9650SE, 9690SA and 9750 
controllers.  If the system does not support Advanced/Basic Verify, you would get 
the following error:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c2 set verify=advanced
 Error: (CLI:146) Basic/Advanced Verify is not supported for the specified controller.</pre>

<p>To set the background verify task with Basic Verify, specify <em>verify=basic</em> 
along with the preferred day and time for the verify task to execute:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt; /c3 set verify=basic pref=Fri:23
 Setting /c3 basic verify preferred start time to [Fri, 11:00PM] ... Done.</pre>
<p>To display the preferred start time and day of the verify task previously set:</p>
<pre>
 //localhost&gt;&gt; /c0 show verify
 /c0 basic verify weekly preferred start: Friday, 11:00PM</pre>
<p>The background verify task will run every Friday starting at 11:00 PM.</p>

<h2><a name="meta_character_warning_">Meta-Character Warning:</a></h2>
<p>If you wish to use CLI in single command mode (not interactive), make sure to avoid
collision with your command interpreter (OS shell) by escaping the meta-characters
(such as ?, &lt;, &gt;, @, &amp;, *, etc) appropriately with single quote around them.</p>
<p>For example, given the</p>
<p>$ tw_cli /c0 ?</p>
<p>This is a case of single command usage where the user intends to get help on Controller
related commands.  While this is a valid CLI command, but since the arguments to CLI
are first processed by the shell, then some shells like <code>csh(1)</code> will interpret the '?' as
a meta-character to be used toward file completion and if no file is found with a single
character, then shell will complain before the arguments are even passed down to CLI.</p>
<p>One solutions of this problem can be :</p>
<p>$ tw_cli help /cx</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>$ tw_cli '/c0 ?'</p>
<p>Note:  Some of the OS shell does not have this problem such as bash.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="reporting_style">Reporting Style</a></h2>
<pre>

tw_cli(8) reporting has changed (hopefully for better). The intent has been to
provide a consistent tabular reporting so that relevant and important information 
(such as B&lt;info&gt;) are made available as fast as possible. For example, firmware,
PCB, PCHIP and similar information have been removed from the info summary report, 
as this type of information is not frequently needed.</pre>
<p>The new style also accommodates automation much better by providing consistent 
columns with or without values so that it could be easily parsed. The intent is
to make CLI yet another API (to approach it).</p>
<p>However to accommodate current automations around tw_cli and to ease the migration,
the old behavior can still be requested by setting <strong>TW_CLI_STYLE</strong> 
environment variable to <strong>OLD</strong> as follows:</p>
<pre>
 If Bash, then &quot;export TW_CLI_STYLE=OLD&quot;
 If csh, then &quot;setenv TW_CLI_STYLE OLD&quot;
 if Windows, then &quot;set TW_CLI_STYLE=OLD&quot;</pre>
<p>This backward compatibility window, will be communicated by official 3ware representatives.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="initialization_process_control">Initialization Process Control</a></h2>
<p>On the 9K series of controllers, the rebuild scheduling controls both rebuild and
initialize processes if it is enabled.  Currently, <code>tw_cli(8)</code>
does not have any direct command to pause or resume an initialization process.
If such action is needed, use the rebuild scheduling to handle it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="environment_variables">Environment Variables</a></h2>
<p>TW_CLI_STYLE setting this variable to OLD, will provide the old reporting style.
TW_CLI_INPUT_STYLE setting this variable to OLD, will disable focus feature in the 
interactive mode.</p>
